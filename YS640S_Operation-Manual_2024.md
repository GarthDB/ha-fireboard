DANGERS, WARNINGS,  AN D CAU TION S

PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE MANUAL BEFORE USING YOUR NEW YODER SMOKERS S-SERIES PELLET GRILL.
Failure to follow the instructions in this manual could result in property damage, bodily injury, or even death.
Contact your local fire officials about restrictions and installation inspection requirements in your area if you
have questions on the positioning of your grill. As with any grill, gases such as carbon monoxide are formed.
Harmful in concentrated quantities, carbon monoxide can lead to death. ONLY USE THIS GRILL in an outdoor,
open-air environment where the carbon monoxide can naturally dissipate and not harm you.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

WARNING!
Safety guidelines to prevent this colorless, odorless gas from poisoning you, your family, your pets, or others:

•  Know  the  symptoms  of  carbon  monoxide
poisoning:  headache,  dizziness,  weakness,
nausea,  vomiting,  sleepiness,  and  confusion.
Carbon  monoxide  reduces  the  blood’s  ability  to
carry oxygen. Low blood oxygen levels can result
in loss of consciousness and death.

•  See a doctor if you or others develop any cold
or flu-like symptoms. Carbon monoxide poisoning,
which can easily be mistaken for a cold or flu, is
often detected too late.

•  Alcohol consumption and drug use increase the
effects of carbon monoxide poisoning.

•  Carbon monoxide is especially toxic to mother
and  child  during  pregnancy,  infants,  the  elderly,
smokers,  and  people  with  blood  or  circulatory
system problems, such as anemia or heart disease.

•  Only  use  your  grill  outdoors  on  a  safe,
noncombustible  surface  and  distanced  from  any
flammable materials or liquids.

•    Do  not  use  gasoline,  charcoal  lighter  fluid,  or
flammable liquids to ignite or maintain the fire in
the grill. Keep all such liquids well away from this
appliance when in use.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

DANGER!
FOR USERS IN NORTH AMERICA:

DANGER!
FOR ALL PRODUCT USERS:

•  An  electrical  supply  with  GFCI  protection  is
required.  To  prevent  and  protect  against  any
shock  hazard,  locate  a  safely  grounded  3-prong
GFCI  receptacle  in  reach  of  the  power  cord.

•  Outdoor  extension  cords  can  be  used  if  they
are surface marked with the suffix letter “W” and
with  a  tag  stating  “Suitable  for  use  with  outdoor
appliances".

FOR USERS OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA:

• Plug into an appropriate earthed outlet.
• Do not remove earth prong or modify plug in.
• Do not use an adapter or extension cord.

• Hazardous voltage is present, which can shock,
burn, or cause death. Disconnect the power cord
before  servicing  the  grill  unless  otherwise  noted
in this Owner’s Manual.

• Never store flammable liquids near the grill.

•  Never  use  gasoline  or  lighter  fluid  to  manually
light your grill.

•  Never  use  your  grill  in  the  rain  or  around  any
source of water.

•  Do  not  use  the  grill  for  anything  other  than  its
intended use.

•  Should  a  grease  fire  occur,  push  the  power
button and immediately unplug the grill to stop the

DANGERS, WARNINGS,  AN D CAU TION S

WARNING!
Burn Hazard:

Many  parts  of  the  grill  will  become  intensely  hot
during operation. Please use caution to avoid burns
both during operation and afterwards while the grill
is still hot.

• Never leave the grill unattended with young
children present.

• Never move the grill during operation.

• Always allow the grill to cool before moving.

WARNING!
Fire Hazard:

• When operating this grill, maintain a MINIMUM
distance of 18 inches (46 cm) between the grill and
any walls or combustible surfaces. See diagram
below.

• When operating the grill under overhead
combustibles or covered patios, a MINIMUM of
40 inches (102 cm) is required.

• The smoker must be level front to back, but it is
not required to be level from left to right as long
as the drip bucket end of the cooker is the lowest
point  — otherwise problems with grease running
towards the burn pot could result in a grease fire.

WARNING!
Air Contaminant Hazard:

• Assemble and operate this grill ONLY per
the instructions in the Assembly Guide and the
Owner’s Manual.

• The grill is intended for outdoor use only.

• Never use heating fuel pellets in the grill, due to
potential hazardous contaminants and additives
that may be present.

CAUTION!
Best Practices:

• Always store pellets in dry location. Pellets
exposed to moisture will not burn properly and
affect the proper operation of the grill. If wet pellets
are left in the hopper, they lock up the auger.

• Keep the grill clean per this manual.

• Do not modify or use accessories not specified
for use with this grill.

• If your previous cooks have produced large
quantities of flammable grease, it is highly
recommended that the grease be cleaned
from the grill before cooking on it again.

• Keep the grill unplugged while not in use.

• After a period of non-use, the hopper, auger,
and firepot must be inspected for obstruction.

COOKING  STYLES + SE TUPS

TIMES, TEMPS, AND HELPFUL TIPS

YOU SHOULD KNOW...

When the cooker is set up traditionally (diffuser plate installed), the heat up time is 20 to 30 minutes.
When the cooker is set up for direct grilling (diffuser plate out), the heat up time is about 15 minutes.

It is also important to note that when the cooker is set up “direct”, the temperature at the center of
the grate is hotter than the reported temperature. How much hotter depends on the set point. At
350°F on the display, the grate center is approximately 425°F. At 475°F on the display, grate center is
approximately 625°F. The difference is caused by the reduction of airflow to the thermocouple when
the direct grates are installed. This is true with the diffuser in or out.

Finally, precise temperature management is not important when you are direct or indirect grilling and
are opening the grill frequently. Simply find a set temperature that works well for the type of food you
are grilling. For instance, burgers or brats do well at a 350° F set point when indirect grilling.

BAKING AND SMOKING WITH THE ADJUSTABLE

VARIABLE DISPLACEMENT DAMPER

The  YS640S  is  fitted  with  a  variable  displacement  damper  for  managing  heat  distribution  while
cooking  with  the  heat  diffuser  plate  in  place.  With  the  damper  pushed  in  about  five  inches,  the
cooking grate surface will cook evenly, creating an ideal environment for slow cooking. For grilling,
the damper should be pulled completely open toward the right side of the grill. (See diagram below)

pre-g rill checklist

YODER SMOKERS RECOMMENDED

PRE-GRILL CHECKLIST

1. Open the cooking chamber door and remove the cooking grates.

2. Remove the access door from the heat diffuser plate. (FIG 13)

3. Remove the burn grate from the firebox (FIG 14). Inspect and clean thoroughly. Make certain that
the combustion holes in the burn grate and the igniter tube in the firebox are free of debris or ash
build up. Visually inspect the air way between the combustion fan and the firebox to be certain that
it is free and clear of ash and debris (a shop vacuum works well for ash and debris removal).

4. While inspecting the firebox assembly, confirm that the igniter assembly, tube and igniter rod are
free  of  ash  or  other  debris.  Periodically  inspect  the  igniter  tube  to  ensure  it  is  tightly  secured  by
grabbing the tube and turning it clockwise.

5. Re-install the burn grate (FIG 15). Begin by resting the right hand side of the burn grate on the
fire box and then pressing down on the left hand side of the burn grate until fully seated. When the
burn grate is properly seated it rests firmly on the right hand side of the firebox and fits close to the
hopper wall. Finally, ensure the igniter assembly is centered in the respective hole in the burn grate.

6. Re-install the access door.

7.  Re-install the cooking grates and second shelf.

8. Remove, inspect, and clean the grease bucket as needed.

9. Open the hopper lid and inspect for any foreign materials, as well as inspect the condition of
pellets left over from previous cooks to ensure they’ve not been damaged by humidity.

you
should
know

If you’ve been smoking cuts of meat with higher fat content or larger quantities of meat or
pork,  you  will  want  to  remove  the  entire  heat  diffuser  plate  and  inspect  the  bottom  of  the
cooking chamber for grease build up. Excess grease in the grill can cause a fire that can be
dangerous and difficult to extinguish. To remove build up of grease in the cooking chamber,
use a plastic putty knife to scrape it up and discard. Take extra care along the seams of the
chamber so as to not damage the silicon seal.

OPERATING T HE  GRILL

RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE FOR

OPERATING THE GRILL

Start-up Procedure
1. Plug the female end of the power cord into the receptacle on the pellet hopper. Next, plug the
male end into a 120 volt, 15 amp GFCI-protected outlet. If an extension cord is required, see caution
notes on page 6 of this manual.

2. Load the hopper with food grade pellets. DO NOT use heating grade pellets.

3. Adjust the variable displacement damper to wide open (pulled outward until it stops).

4. Push the power button. This starts the combustion air fan and illuminates the LED power light.

5. Press the START button on the control panel to activate the auger feed system. This will prime the
burn grate with pellets for the fire. At 30 seconds, the igniter is powered on; within 2 minutes, the
heat from the igniter and the combustion air from the fans will have a small smoldering fire started.

6. Set your desired cooking temperature by adjusting the rotary selector knob. If you do not adjust the
temperature, it will automatically heat to the default temperature set point of 350°F. The temperature
can be adjusted at any time during the cook.

7. Once the temperature reaches the set point, typically 30 minutes, place your food on the grates.

you
should
know

Once the start cycle has been activated, an “up arrow” will appear on the display panel next
to the set temperature indicating “heat up” mode. Once the grate temperature reaches 110°F,
the  actual  grate  temperature  will  then  be  displayed.  When  the  target  temperature  range  is
attained, a diamond will be displayed next to the set temp to indicate “Maintenance Mode”.

SHUTDOWN PROCEDURE
1. When finished cooking, push the power button. The screen will begin flashing “Powering Off”.

2. Allow the combustion cooling fan to continue running until the fire is burned clean. The fan will
continue to run until the cooker temperature reaches 125° F or 18 minutes, whichever occurs first.

3. When the cooling procedure is complete, the fan and power LED will turn off, and the controller
will power down. At this point, it is safe to unplug the cooker from its power source.
DO NOT UNPLUG UNTIL THE LED POWER LIGHT IS OFF.

FI RE BOARD APP

CONFIGURING WIFI
Tap your cooker’s serial number from the list, and a few tasks can be accomplished from this new
screen (FIG 22), but for now, we’re interested in getting Wi-Fi connectivity configured, so tap on the
“Manage WiFi” option.

In this new screen (FIG 23), you’ll notice a place for a network name and a password. If you already
know the network name you’ll be using, or if the network you use is not broadcasting its name (also
referred to as an SSID), you can enter the name and password of the WiFi router or access point on
the provided lines. Please note that network names and passwords are case sensitive.

If you’re unsure of the exact spelling of your network name, or you are unsure of which networks are
within the range of your cooker, you can use the “View Available Networks” button to have your
mobile device scan for nearby 2.4GHz networks (FIG 24).

the WiFi icon on your cooker’s listing will activate (FIG 25). If, after a minute or so, it does not, try
re-entering your network name and password, and try connecting again.

22

THE APP IN DEPTH
Before we get into all the details, we’d like to point out that the cooker cannot be started from the
app. You will have full control once it has been started - including the ability to shut it down - but
the cooker must be started from its front panel before the app can do anything aside from reporting
current status. This helps ensure the safe operation of your cooker.

THE DASHBOARD
If you click on the first icon of the tab bar (the navigation that spans across the bottom of the screen),
you’ll be presented with the Dashboard (FIG 26). This is your quick overview screen, as well as one
of the main sections you’ll use to interact with your cooker.

The large gray bar across the top indicates your cooker’s current setpoint, internal temperature, and
the temperature of the two probes, if you have them plugged in. If you don’t have the probes plugged
in, or the pit is not currently running, you will see dashes in place of the temperature readings.

Below  the  large  grey  bar  is  an  area  used  to  show  the  various  temperature  readings  available  in
graph format. We will get into more detail on this in a bit.

Once the cooker is running, the setpoint and pit values will reflect the current status
of the pit (FIG 27).

FIG 26

FIG 27

FI RE BOARD APP

NOTABLE DASHBOARD FEATURES
• You can change the pit’s setpoint by tapping on the setpoint in the gray banner (FIG 28). Simply
enter  your new desired setpoint and tap the “Set” button. Please note that changes to the setpoint
take a few seconds to take effect. Please be patient for them to be reflected in the cooker and in the
app’s dashboard.

• The names of the two probe ports can be set according to what you’re cooking. Tapping on the
probe port in the grey banner will allow you to change its name (FIG 29). This name will also be used
in the various charts throughout the app.

• An alert – in the form of an app alert, an SMS text message, or an email – can be set to let you know
when one of the meat probes are at a certain temp. Simply tap on the temperature shown for the
probe in the gray banner, tapping “Add New Alert,” then “Set-up Alert” and set up your parameters
(FIG 29, 30).

FIG 28

FIG 29

FIG 30

Alerts can be restricted to only occur during specific times of the day or at a given frequency by
using the “Custom Start/Stop Time” selection. Please note that SMS text and email alerts require a
little bit of set-up in the settings screen, which is described later in this document.

24

NOTABLE DASHBOARD FEATURES  (CONTINUED)
• You can choose between two visualizations of the running temperature data: a basic chart, and
a  detailed  chart.  You  can  toggle  between  the  two  by  tapping  on  the  word  “Chart”  or  “Detail,”
respectively, in the title bar area of the app (FIG 31, 32).

• Tapping the small wrench icon in the upper right of the gray bar will take you to a section that allows
you to choose between multiple cookers (if you have more than one paired to your mobile device)
(FIG 33) and also allows you to shut down your cooker (FIG 34).

FI RE BOARD APP

SESSIONS
The second icon from the left on the icon bar will navigate you to the sessions screen. This is straight-
forward. A session is a record of pit and probe temperatures throughout a cook. Sessions are created
automatically when probes are plugged in, or your cooker is started. By clicking the plus sign (on
Android) or the “New” button (on iOS), a new session can be started at the time of your choosing.
Sessions display as graphs, very similar to the detail graph shown in the dashboard.

PROGRAMS
Your cooker can be set up to execute a series of instructions that construct a cooking plan, called a
program. This program consists of one or more steps that run until a criterion is met.  That criterion can
be a set amount of time or until one of the two meat probes hit a given temperature. The programs
section can be reached by tapping the third icon from the left on the apps tab bar (FIG 35). To add
a new program, tap on the “Add New Program” button.  A new dialog will pop up to prompt you to
choose the type of program you’d like to add (FIG 36).

FIG 35

FIG 36

26

PROGRAMS  (CONTINUED)
You have three options:
• Time Cook: Cooks at a given setpoint for a given amount of time. Once complete, the cooker will
  change its setpoint to given holding temperature. All three parameters are user-definable.
• Temp Cook: Cooks at a given temperature until one of the probes reaches a given temperature.
   Once complete, the cooker will change its setpoint to a given holding temperature. Again, all three
  parameters are user-definable.
•  Custom Drive Program: A complete user-definable series of steps that can combine cooker
  setpoints, run-times, and measured probe temps to form any conceivable cook plan you desire.

For the purposes of this manual, we’ll walk through a simple custom program example for cooking

ROU TINE MAIN TENANCE

RECOMMENDED INSPECTION PROCESS FOR

ROUTINE COOKER MAINTENANCE

COOKING GRATES
Every three months, or depending on use, bring the cooker up to the desired cooking temperature
and use a cooker brush to clean the grates before evenly coating the grates with vegetable oil.

HEAT DIFFUSER PLATE
Every three months, or depending on use, it is recommended that the heat diffuser plate is scraped
clean to removed any buildup of grease. A plastic putty knife is ideal for this process.

STAINLESS STEEL BURN GRATE
It is important to regularly check the combustion air holes located on the floor and sides of the burn
grate for any blockage or build-up. Using a wire brush or flat-head screwdriver, scrape off any build-
up or debris. To access the burn grate, remove the access door.

BURN GRATE INSPECTION
To ensure the pit is burning efficiently, a visual inspection of the burn grate is required periodically.
The burn grate should sit flat against the back wall of the fire box. Due to the intense heat that is
created, the burn grate can change shape. There should be no more than a 1/8” gap from the back
wall to the burn grate. If a larger gap exists, it must be corrected as follows:

1. Start by removing the burn grate from the firebox and placing it on its top.

2. Next, carefully step on the burn grate (see diagram below) and apply enough pressure to bend
it back to its original shape. DO NOT apply too much pressure or you will overcorrect the burn grate
and it will not fit back into the firebox.

3. Place the burn grate back into the firebox and check the gap between the back wall and the burn
grate to ensure a proper fit. If a gap still exists, then repeat steps 1 and 2.

34

ROUT INE  MAI NTEN ANCE

CERAMIC IGNITER
When inspecting the firebox assembly, confirm that the igniter assembly, tube and igniter rod are
free  of  ash  or  other  debris.  Periodically  inspect  the  igniter  tube  to  ensure  it  is  tightly  secured  by
grabbing the tube and turning it clockwise.

COOKING CHAMBER
It is recommended every 7-10 cooks you inspect and thoroughly clean the interior of the cooking
chamber.  Any  excess  grease  can  be  cleaned  up  using  a  plastic  scraper  and  paper  towels.  Pay
particular  attention  to  the  grease  channels  on  the  right  hand  side  of  the  cooking  body.  At  the
beginning of the season, and as necessary throughout the rest of the year, degrease-grease the
interior with a citrus based cleaning solution. Ensure that the cooker is completely cold before using
a shop vacuum or before scooping out and disposing of the ashes.

It is recommended that the firebox assembly is regularly inspected to be certain that it remains free
of ash and debris which will ensure proper performance. The firebox is a fully welded structure that
carries the burn grate and channels the combustion air. It is bolted to the cooking chamber floor. The
seams on the hopper wall and the floor of the cooking chamber are sealed with a high temperature
silicone. Perform regular inspection of the silicone seal. If any seal is broken, remove the old silicone,
clean the surface, reapply new high temperature silicone, and let it cure for 24 hours before use. We
recommend using Permatex 81160 high temperature silicone or Sure Bond SB-188.

The seating of the burn grate into the firebox is critical for proper cooker performance. Begin by
resting the right hand side of the burn grate on the fire pot and then pressing down on the left hand
side of the burn grate until fully seated. Once the burn grate is seated there is little-to-no movement
in this assembly. Also, check to be certain that the igniter assembly is centered in the respective hole
in the burn grate.

GREASE MANAGEMENT AREA
Visually inspect the grease drain and surrounding area for buildup, and scrape clean as needed.

EXTERIOR PAINTED SURFACES
Yoder Smokers are painted with high heat silicone paint. When cleaning the smoker, surfaces should
be washed with mild soap and water to remove any grease, food oils, errant seasoning sprays or
rubs as they are corrosive to the surface. The paint should be periodically inspected and touched up
when scuffs or bare spots are exposed. For information about high-heat paint that can be used for
touch-up, contact customerservice@yodersmokers.com.

EXTERIOR RUST PREVENTION
Every six months, we recommend seasoning the exterior of your grill to protect and maintain the
integrity of the paint, as well as the endurance of the finish. First, wash the exterior of the grill with
mild soap and water. Once dry, coat the pit with a high quality mineral oil or ACF-50, an Ultra Thin
Fluid Compound (UTFC) that actively treats metal using advanced polar bonding technology. Once
applied, allow the pit to run at 375 degrees until the oil is absorbed into the paint completely.

RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE FOR RESTORING

WIFI CONNECTIVITY

RECONNECT FIREBOARD TO WIFI
To  regain  your  WiFi  connection,  go  to  the  Fireboard  app  on  your  mobile  device  and  tap  on  the
“Settings” icon on the bottom right of your screen. From here, tap on the name of your FireBoard
under “Devices”, and then tap “Manage WiFi”.  If your mobile device is already connected WiFi, the
app will auto-populate your network name for you — just enter your network password and press
“OK”. The FireBoard may take up to a minute to connect. Your network name will be displayed in
your app once connected.

If you attempt to connect without success, your ACS Controller’s wireless settings may need to be
reset. On the “Configure WiFi” screen, simply press “Reset WiFi”, wait a few seconds and attempt
to  connect  the  WiFi  again.  This  action  will  remove  any  previously  entered  credentials  that  could
possibly be causing a connection issue. Once reset, try connecting again.

SIGNAL STRENGTH AND FREQUENCY
If you are having trouble maintaining a wireless connection to your FireBoard, it could be your signal
strength. Signal strength is represented in -dBm format (0 to -100). The closer the value is to 0, the
stronger the signal. For example, -41dBm is a better signal strength than -61dBm. Anything lower
than -70dBm will make it hard for the FireBoard to maintain a connection.

To check your signal strength on your ACS Controller w/FireBoard unit on the app, tap on “Settings”
then select your device and tap on “Device Log”.  Scroll down until you see signal level.

IF YOU DO HAVE A POOR WI-FI CONNECTION, THERE ARE A FEW THINGS YOU CAN TRY:

- Ensure your wireless network is 2.4 GHz
- Confirm that the antenna is secured tight to the hopper and confirm there is no visual damage.
  (The antenna is located under the cart on comp cart models.)
- Move your wireless router closer to the FireBoard
- Install a range extender on your network

FREQUENCY
The  wireless  module  in  all  current  generation  FireBoards  only  supports  2.4GHz.  Many  wireless
routers have a 5GHz option, but this frequency sacrifices both range and ability to transmit through
walls or structures. If your router supports both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz and your SSID and password are
the  same  for  both,  this  can  cause  an  error  when  connecting.  Make  sure  that  you  use  a  different
password for each frequency.

TRO UBLESHOO TIN G I GNITION

TROUBLESHOOTING FAILED IGNITION

RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE FOR

WARNING:  If  your  pellet  cooker  fails  to  start,  you  MUST  remove  the  grates,  heat  diffuser  and
any accumulated pellets BEFORE you attempt to start it again. Failure to do so could result in an
uncontrollable fire in the body of the cooker, which has the potential to cause physical damage to
the cooker.

1. THE BURN GRATE WAS NOT EMPTIED OF ASH FROM PREVIOUS USE.
To prevent this type of failure from excessive ash, prior to use, empty all of the ash from the burn
grate and firepot. As ash accumulates in the burn grate, it can overwhelm the igniter and prevent
contact with the pellets, so keeping it clean will prevent issues with combustion.

2. THE BURN GRATE DOES NOT FIT CORRECTLY INSIDE THE FIREPOT.
The high heat generated from burning pellets in the burn grate can cause the burn grate to change
shape, which may cause the misalignment of the igniter assembly. Follow the procedures outlined
on page 34 to correct the fitment of the burn grate.

3. THE IGNITER IS NOT ALIGNED PROPERLY WITHIN THE HOLE OF THE BURN GRATE.
The opening of the igniter tube must be positioned higher than the bottom of the burn grate. To
properly align the igniter assembly to the burn grate, you may gently pull up or push down on the
end of the igniter tube to correctly align it with the hole in the burn grate. NEVER touch the igniter
unless it is completely cold.

4. THE PELLETS MAY BE DAMAGED BY MOISTURE OR BE OF POOR QUALITY.
Poor quality or compromised pellets can prevent proper ignition. Pellets with too much moisture will
begin to swell and will not ignite when heated. The quality of a pellet can also be a cause of improper
ignition. A quality pellet will have a coating or “shine” on the outside. When a pellet loses it’s shine,
it is a sign of the pellet becoming degraded and become difficult or unable to ignite when heated.

5. THE IGNITER IS DAMAGED OR FAULTY.
Performing factory reset may restore proper igniter function.  To do this, press the power button then
Menu/Settings/Advanced/Factory Reset and follow the on screen instructions.  Once the controller
has been reset, perform a visual test of the igniter, refer to page 43. If you find that the igniter does
not glow during the test, then it will need to be replaced.

 MANUALLY IGNIT ING THE GR ILL

RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE FOR

MANUALLY IGNITING THE GRILL

Here are the steps to manually light the cooker in the event that the igniter fails. (Steps 2 & 3 only
apply if the igniter has developed a dead short and is tripping the GFCI or blowing the fuse.)

1. Be sure the unit power cord is unplugged. Remove the cooking grates, diffuser plate and burn grate.

2. Reach into the firebox and locate the wires connected to the igniter, then pull the igniter wires
    into the firebox.

3. Unplug the igniter’s weathertight connection and then push the wires back into the opening.

4. Reinstall the burn grate and place a small handful of pellets into the grate.

5. Light the pellets with a torch, starter gel or starter stick.

6. Once lit, plug the power cord into a GFCI outlet and press the power button. Once the Men
     screen is displayed, press Start. The feed system begins the prime cycle before defaulting to the
     set temperature feed rate.

7.  Set the desired cooking temperature (default set point is 350° F).

8. Your smoker will begin to produce smoke during “startup” within approximately 3 to 5 minutes.
    To check if the pellets ignited, open the smoker and a flame should be visible in the burn pot
    area. You will be able to view this without having to touch any hot surfaces.

FR EQUENTLY  ASKED QUESTIO N S

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

QUESTION

ANSWER

WHY DOES MY GRILL OVERSHOOT THE
SET POINT / TEMPERATURE AT STARTUP?

The initial overshoot is dependent on how much fuel has been fed
into the firebox during the initial heat-up of the grill. Allow 20-30
minutes for the temperature to stabilize before placing food inside.

WHAT BRAND OF PELLETS ARE
RECOMMENDED TO USE IN MY GRILL?

CAN I USE AN EXTENSION CORD?

WHY DOES THE TEMPERATURE
FLUCTUATE ON MY GRILL?

BBQR’s Delight brand is recommended as they provide the
maximum performance, consistency, and low ash from bag to bag.
Yoder Smokers uses them exclusively for all product testing and
development at the factory.

Yes. Make sure it is a heavy-duty cord rated for outdoor use and
marked with the suffix letter “W” as well as with a tag stating
“Suitable for use with outdoor appliances."

You are cooking with a live, wood fire. As a result there will be
temperature swings — the grill will not hit your set point and remain
fixed. As pellets are added and burned, the temperature will go
above and below your set point. The ACS controller works to
maintain an average temperature over a span of time.

AT WHAT TEMPERATURE SHOULD THE HEAT
DIFFUSER/ACCESS DOOR BE REMOVED?

400° F

WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE
TO SEASON THE EXTERIOR OF THE GRILL?

Wash the exterior of the grill with mild soap and water. Once dry, coat
the grill with mineral oil or ACF-50. Next, allow the grill to run at 375° F
degrees until the oil is absorbed into the paint completely.

WHAT HAPPENS IF MY PELLETS RUN OUT?

The controller has a reignite feature in the event you run out of
pellets and lose your fire. First, inspect the firepot remove excess
ash or pellets. Select ‘Menu’, then scroll to ‘Reignite’.

CAN I START MY GRILL USING THE APP?

For safety, the grill cannot be started from the app.

HOW DO I SET UP THE GRILL
FOR DIRECT COOKING?

Remove the heat diffuser plate, set the variable displacement
damper to the full-open position, and install the optional GrillGrate®
cooking grates on the left side of the grill, above the fire box.

HOW DO I SET UP THE GRILL
FOR INDIRECT COOKING?

Keep the heat diffuser plate and access door in place, then install
the optional GrillGrate® cooking grates or standard cooking grates.

TEM PERATURE TEST

RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE FOR THE

ACS TEMPERATURE TEST

This test will allow you to verify that your pellet cooker is functioning normally. When running this test,
it is strongly suggested that you use BBQr’s Delight brand pellets, if available. For proper results,
remove old pellets from the hopper and use fresh pellets.

This test will take 2 hours. Please make sure the ACS controller is connected to the Fireboard app via
Wi-Fi prior to starting the test. External temperature probes MUST be located on the bottom grate
EXACTLY at the locations shown in the diagram below.

The tip of Probe 1 should be precisely 11 inches from the left wall of the grill, the tip of probe 2 should
be 22 inches from the left wall of the grill, and the variable displacement damper should be pulled
outward to the right. (See diagram below)

44

TE MPE RAT URE  T EST

TE MPE RAT URE  T EST

1.  This test requires that you first completely clean your cooker by vacuuming all ash from the burn
     grate, firepot, and the entire body of the cooker. You also need to clean all cooking debris and
     degrease all surfaces inside the cooker, including the heat diffuser, thermocouple, grease
     channel (including the drain hole), and inside the chimney.

2. Verify the silicone seals are not damaged or missing from around the firepot. Clean and repair all
     silicone seals per the manual, if necessary, BEFORE continuing with the test.

3. Ensure that the burn grate fitment into the firepot is as specified on page 34 of this manual.
    Correct the fitment prior to continuing the test, per the instructions in the manual, if required.

4. Unplug the power cord, wait 30 seconds, and plug the power cord back into the cooker.

5. Verify that you have the pellet hopper full, and if not, add pellets.

6. Open the lid to the cooker, press the “Power” button followed by the “Start” button.

7. Set your desired test temperature. DO NOT CHANGE THE TEMPERATURE AFTER SETTING IT.

8. After you see fire in the burn grate, close the door on the cooker.

9. From this point forward, for the duration of the test, DO NOT OPEN THE GRILL’S DOOR.

10. Once the test has concluded, please take the following pictures listed below and email them,
     along with what session contains the test data AND the email address used for the FireBoard
     app, to this address: customerservice@yodersmokers.com

• Inside the cooker showing the probe placement on the grates
• Inside the cooker with the cooking grates removed and heat diffuser in place
• Inside the cooker showing the firebox with the burn grate installed

Because pellet cookers are burning wood, it is impossible to have a listing of data points that are
all the same as the temperature setting on the controller. There will be higher temperature readings
as pellets are fed into the burn grate and ignite, thus adding additional heat into the cooker (bigger
fire). There will also be lower temperature readings as the pellets are consumed and turned to ash,
allowing for the cooker to cool down (smaller fire). Also, the temperature shown on the display, unlike
any external temperature probes used, is not shown in “real time”. The temperature shown on the
display is a rolling 90 second average.

Should you choose to analyze the data yourself, calculate the average of all the readings from the
display,  and  optionally,  do  the  same  for  the  external  temperature  probe(s).  Compare  the  average
readings from the display that you calculated, to the original temperature that you set on the controller
at the beginning of the test. If the average is within 35 degrees, high or low, of the controller set
temperature, your cooker is functioning as it should.

45

ACS C ONTROLLER OFFSET

RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE FOR INPUTTING A

CUSTOM TEMPERATURE OFFSET

Calibration of the ACS controller is a function that allows you to “dial in” your cookers performance,
based on your requirements. This calibration is NOT something that you do constantly, but rather
something  that  you  may  do  to  periodically  verify  your  cooker’s  performance.  Calibration  is  NOT
required for your cooker to function, but gives you the ability to enter an offset that will provide a
more  accurate  display  temperature  on  the  controller  compared  to  the  lower  cooking  grate  level
temperature. By default, the controller is displaying the temperatures at the lower cooking grate level
and not the ambient temperature inside the chamber. NEVER change the calibration of the controller
with food in the cooker, as calibration is a function that requires a specific set of parameters to be
followed when the cooker is empty.

The following steps will instruct you on inputting an offset into your ACS controller. We recommend
inputting an offset into the controller ONLY after completing the factory temp test.

To  calculate  the  offset  after  performing  the  test,  input  half  of  the  average  difference  between
the probes and the controller display. The goal is to tell the controller that the actual lower grate
temperature differs from the temperature shown on the display. The offset creates an adjustment
to bring the display temperature closer to the actual temperature. Example: If you find the probes
average 20 degrees hotter than the display, you will enter a +10 degree offset.

If you would like assistance with determining the offset for your cooker, please share the test session
with Customer Service by emailing customerservice@yodersmokers.com once the test is complete.

1. Power on the controller and wait for the main menu
to show. Then press the button next to “Menu” on the
controller.

2. Rotate the selector knob clockwise to highlight the
“Settings” option then press the selector knob.
